# AgentEvent / Pending* in this file are annotation-only (safe under `from __future__ import

HELP_TEXT = """Tip: click the ✨ Features button (top of the window) for a searchable list of
EVERYTHING Ember can do, with a one-click "Open" for each. Or type /features.

How Ember's buttons work
The Command Center has two kinds of buttons:
  • Apps & tools — OPEN a feature (Phone Link, Ember Browser, Antivirus, Sandbox,
    Usage, Plugins, Manual bridge).
  • Quick tasks — TYPE a request into the chat and send it. They're just examples;
    you can also type any request yourself.

Slash commands  (type these, or use the Quick-task buttons)

Autonomy
  /autopilot  take over a computer task end-to-end
  /apps       operate the current desktop app
  /research   browse, compare sources, and report back
  /create     create a local file or asset
  /automate   build a background rule
  /schedule   create/list/cancel timed tasks

System
  /diagnose   full crash/error scan
  /info       OS / CPU / GPU / RAM
  /perf       live performance snapshot
  /crashes    recent crashes only
  /updates    recent Windows updates
  /drivers    installed drivers
  /fixes      list quick-fix recipes

Files
  /organize   organize a folder by type
  /dedupe     find duplicate files
  /biggest    find space-hog files
  /downloads  organize my Downloads

Web
  /web        open automation browser
  /shot       take a screenshot

Features (open a tool)
  /remote     start Ember Link for phone control
  /browser    open the Ember Browser app (tab groups + password manager)
  /passwords  manage saved website logins
  /vpn        connect / disconnect your WireGuard VPN
  /workflow   record & replay mouse/keyboard workflows
  /record     record your screen to a video
  /snippets   manage reusable text snippets
  /macros     save & run named task macros
  /localai    use a local Ollama model (offline, no key, no limits)
  /usage      show API usage vs the free-tier limits
  /plugins    manage drop-in plugin tools
  /manual     bridge an external AI

Session
  /voice      toggle hands-free voice chat
  /windows    list open windows
  /clear      clear chat
  /forget     wipe saved facts
  /update     install the latest Ember version
  /help       this list

More you can just ASK for (no command needed)
  • "save a snippet" / "expand ;sig" — reusable text snippets
  • "record a workflow" / "replay <name>" — record & replay mouse+keyboard
  • "record my screen for 20s" — screen recorder
  • "has my email been breached?" — email breach check
  • "scan this download" — and turn on real-time download protection in Settings
  • Settings ▸ Models: store API keys in the encrypted vault
  • Plugins: drop a .py in the plugins/ folder to add your own tools (/plugins)

Global hotkey: configurable in Settings -> Performance (default Ctrl+Shift+Space).
Drop a file/folder onto the chat to discuss it.

Tip: just say "organize my Downloads", "find duplicates in Pictures",
"why is my PC slow", "open my GoPro folder" -- no command needed.
"""


# Command Center, grouped so a new user can tell the two kinds of buttons apart:
#  - "Apps & tools" OPEN a feature/window (Phone Link, Browser, Antivirus, …).
#  - "Quick tasks" TYPE a request into the chat and send it (they are example prompts).
# Each entry is (label, command, tooltip). A command starting with "__" opens a feature;
# anything else is a prompt/slash that gets sent to Ember as a request.
