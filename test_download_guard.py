"""Fast, deterministic tests for download_guard.

We never touch the real antivirus engine or the real Downloads folder:
  * `download_guard._SCANNER` is replaced with a fake that returns a result
    shaped like antivirus.scan_file (a "verdict" key: "malicious" for files
    whose path contains "evil", else "clean").
  * The guard is pointed at pytest's tmp_path so it watches an isolated folder.

Every test stops the watcher in a finally block so pytest exits cleanly.
