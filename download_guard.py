"""Real-time download protection for Ember.

A single background daemon thread polls the watched folder (default the user's
Downloads) every ~2 seconds. When a NEW file appears AND has finished being
written (its size is stable across two polls — guarding against scanning a
half-finished download), it is scanned with the antivirus engine. Threats are
recorded in a bounded in-memory event log and surfaced via the status/events
tools (your wiring can raise an alert / toast from there).

Design notes (mirrors extra_tools.watch_folder_* — daemon thread + a bounded
events buffer behind a lock):
  * No watchdog dependency: os.scandir + a seen-set of already-known paths.
  * In-progress download extensions (.crdownload/.part/.download/.tmp) are
    skipped until they settle into their final name.
  * `_SCANNER` is a module-level injection point. Default None -> the worker
    lazily `import antivirus; antivirus.scan_file(path)`. Tests set `_SCANNER`
    to a fake so nothing real is imported and the test stays fast/offline.
  * State is in-memory only — nothing is persisted to disk.

Standard library only at import time (antivirus is imported lazily, inside the
scan worker, so importing this module stays light and testable).
